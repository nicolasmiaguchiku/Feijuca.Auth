## 💡 Considerations

This project is specifically designed for applications that adhere to the current **.NET supported versions**.

However, the **Feijuca.Auth.Api** module can be accessed from any programming language, as it processes calls against Keycloak.

If you intend to use only the API module (for creating users, managing groups, sessions, and tokens), you can do so without having **.NET** in your technology stack, as it is a RESTful API.

If your stack is built with **.NET**, you'll benefit from enhanced capabilities and integration options. As you progress through the documentation, you'll gain a better understanding of these advantages.

### 🔧 Prerequisites
- An instance of **Keycloak** server.
